NOTE: This Plugin requires HTML, css and PHP files too.


This plugin can be used when multiple options are to be selected from a list.
Good Old "<select>" tag can only select one option at a time. Well, this helps to select multiple options too.

In the server side, this plugin can be implemented by any language, but I have written it only for PHP.
You can try implementing this plugin for other languages too, it's not that hard, just basic templating stuffs only.
